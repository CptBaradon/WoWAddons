LibTalentQuery-1.0:
- Huge performance improvements over previous versions. Full raid of 25 players can be talent scanned reliably in around 15-20 seconds, compared to the 2 or more minutes of older versions.
- Added new fired event 'TalentQuery_Ready_Outsider' to allow catching of talent scans triggered by other sources for opportunistic talent re-scan.
- Fixed return values for NameToUnitID target/pettarget units, and fixed non local 'unit'.
